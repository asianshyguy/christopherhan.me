            This project was a submission for the 2018 Cannes Future Lions competition organized by AKQA. I worked with a classmate in designing a solution that “was not possible 3 years ago.”<br>
            This year we decided to tackle the global problem of food waste by leveraging the Pinterest app’s improved computer vision technology. The idea was to create a product that improved the resourcefulness of the population and encouraged users to use everything they have in their fridge. <br>
            We worked through the ideation phase together, developing the product’s design. Then, Caitlin designed the communication angle we wanted to take, and I animated a motion graphics piece to illustrate the benefits of Pinterest Mixtures.
